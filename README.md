# light_weighted_CNN_for_FER

constructing now :)

This network is light weighted CNN for face emotion recognition.
This project used CK+ dataset, having 7 emotion classes.
The network recorded 57,655 parameters and train 96%, test 95% in Ck+ dataset.

This project will continue to be revised.
I am going to experiment with different datasets, I'll be updated soon :)
