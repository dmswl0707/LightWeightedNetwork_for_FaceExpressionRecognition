# light_weighted_CNN_for_FER

constructing now :)

This project is Face Expression Recognition using lighted weighted Convolution Neural Network.
The network was trained with cK+, FER2013 dataset.
It recorded 57,655 parameter which means it works in limited computer condition.

It will continue to report specific records about this project. see you soon!
