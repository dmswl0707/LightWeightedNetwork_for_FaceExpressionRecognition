# Light_weighted_CNN_for_FER

## constructing now :)

This project is Face Expression Recognition using lighted weighted Convolution Neural Network.
The network was trained with cK+, FER2013 dataset.
It recorded 57,655 parameter which means it works in limited computer condition.

This customed model contain residual blocks, SE blocks for achieving high feature extraction and more lighter weights.
And also the model is added with dilated convolutions for feature expression.

## Networks description 👇🏻👇🏻
this session is going to open up soon :)

### It will continue to report specific records about this project. see you soon!
